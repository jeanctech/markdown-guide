# Block Quotes in Markdown

You can create citation blocks in Markdown by using the greater than symbol (`>`) at the beginning of each line you want to cite. Quote blocks typically have a different visual format and are used to highlight text, quotes, or text fragments. Here's how to create citation blocks in Markdown:

``markdown
> This is a block quote.
> You can use it to highlight text or quotes.
> You can even nest blocks of quotes.
>> This is a nested quote block.
```

The above code will render as:

> This is a block quote.
> You can use it to highlight text or quotes.
> You can even nest blocks of quotes.
>> This is a nested quote block.

Citation blocks are especially useful when you want to highlight information in your Markdown document. You can use them to cite passages of text from other sources, highlight important notes, or visually separate cited text from the rest of the content.
