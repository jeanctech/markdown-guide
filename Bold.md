# Bold in Markdown

To apply bold formatting in Markdown, you can use two asterisks (`**`) or two underscores (`__`) around the text you want to make bold. Here are examples of how to do it:

```markdown
**This text will be in bold**
__This text will also be in bold__
```

When using this syntax, the text surrounded by asterisks or underscores will appear in bold when the document is rendered. For example:

```markdown
**This text will be in bold**
```

Note that Markdown is widely supported and the syntax for applying bold is fairly consistent across different platforms and editors that support Markdown.
