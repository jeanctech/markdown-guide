# Text Links in Markdown

In Markdown, you can create text links using the following syntax:

```markdown
[Link text](URL)
```

Where "Link Text" is the text you want to display as the link and "URL" is the web address the link points to. Here is an example:

```markdown
[Example website](https://www.example.com)
```

In this example, "Example Website" is the link text that will be displayed in the document, and "https://www.example.com" is the web address that the link will take readers to when they click in it.

You can use this syntax to create text links in your Markdown documents, making it easy to link to external resources, websites, or related pages.
