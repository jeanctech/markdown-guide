# Makdown Text Format

In Markdown, you can format text using a variety of elements. Below are the most common text formats:

1. **Bold:** To make the text appear bold, you can use two asterisks `**` or two underscores `__` around the text.

    Example:
    ```markdown
    **Bold text**
    __Bold text__
    ```

2. **Italics:** To italicize text, use a single asterisk `*` or a single underscore `_` around the text.

    Example:
    ```markdown
    *Text in italics*
    _Text in italics_
    ```

3. **Strikethrough text:** If you want the text to appear strikethrough, you can use two `~~` tildes around the text.

    Example:
    ```markdown
    ~~Striked out text~~
    ```

4. **Text in code:** To format the text as code, use the backtick (\`) around the text.

    Example:
    ```markdown
    `Online code`
    ```

5. **Subscript and superscript:** You can use the underscore `_` to create subscript text and the caret `^` to create superscript text.

    Example:
    ```markdown
    H~2~O (water)
    X^2^ (X squared)
    ```

6. **Long Quotes or Code Blocks:** If you want to display a block of text as a long quote or code block, place a greater sign `>` at the beginning of each line.

    Example:
    ```markdown
    >This is a long quote.
    > Can be useful for highlighting text or code.
    ```

7. **Horizontal line:** To insert a horizontal line, you can use three dashes `-`, three asterisks `*`, or three underscores `_` on a separate line.

    Example:
    ```markdown
    ---
    ```

8. **Links and references:** To create links, use square brackets `[]` for the link text and parentheses `()` for the link URL. You can also use reference tags for longer links.

    Example:
    ```markdown
    [Link text](https://www.example.com)
    [Link with reference][1]

    [1]: https://www.otroexample.com
    ```

These are some of the most common text formats in Markdown. You can combine them to format your documents effectively and readably.
