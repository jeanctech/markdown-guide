# Ordered Lists in Markdown

To create ordered lists in Markdown, use numbers followed by a period and a space before each list item. Here are examples of how to create ordered lists in Markdown:

```markdown
1. First element
2. Second element
3. Third element
```

Markdown will render this as:

```markdown
1. First element
2. Second element
3. Third element
```

You can use sequential numbers (1, 2, 3) or any number (even negative numbers) followed by a period and a space before each list item. Markdown will automatically generate the correct numbering in the final document. For example:

```markdown
7. Seventh element
3. Third element
10. Tenth element
```

It will render as:

```markdown
7. Seventh element
3. Third element
10. Tenth element
```

Markdown will take care of ordering them correctly in the final result.

Note that in Markdown, numbers do not need to be in sequential order. You can number the elements as best suits you in your document.
