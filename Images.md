# Images in Markdown

To insert images into Markdown, use the following syntax:

```markdown
![Alt text](Image url)
```

- "Alt text" is a description of the image that will be displayed if the image cannot be loaded or to assist visually impaired users. It is important to include descriptive alternative text.
- "Image URL" is the web address of the image you want to display.

Here is an example of how to insert an image in Markdown:

```markdown
![Markdown Logo](https://www.example.com/logo.png)
```

In this example, "Markdown Logo" is the alt text, and "https://www.example.com/logo.png" is the URL of the image that will be displayed in the document.

Markdown will automatically render this syntax as an image in the final document. Readers will see the image and if they hover over it, they will be able to see the alt text as a tooltip.

Make sure you provide valid URLs for the images and that the images are available online for readers to view.
