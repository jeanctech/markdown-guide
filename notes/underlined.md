# Underline in Markdown

Markdown does not provide a native syntax for applying underlining directly to text. However, you can achieve a similar effect by using Html in your Markdown document. To underline text, you can use the Html `<u>` tag. Here is an example:

```markdown
<u>This text will be underlined</u>
```

This will look like this:

```markdown
<u>This text will be underlined</u>
```

It is important to note that the ability to use Html in Markdown may vary depending on the platform or editor you are using. Most popular Markdown platforms and editors support Html, but I recommend checking compatibility in case you are using a specific environment.
