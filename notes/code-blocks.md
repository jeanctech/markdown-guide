# Code Blocks in Markdown

To create code blocks in Markdown, you can use triple backticks (```) on separate lines before and after the code block. You can optionally specify the programming language so that the code is highlighted properly. Here's how to do it:

## Code blocks without specifying the language

If you don't want to specify the programming language, simply use triple backticks on separate lines before and after the code block. Here is an example:

``markdown
This is a block of code in Markdown.
You can include multiple lines of code here.
``

This will look like this:

``markdown
This is a block of code in Markdown.
You can include multiple lines of code here.
``

### Code blocks with language specification

If you want to highlight the syntax of code in a specific programming language, you can specify the language after the first triple backtick. Here is an example using JavaScript:

```javascript
function greet() {
   console.log("Hello, world");
}
```

This will look like this, with syntax highlighting for JavaScript:

```javascript
function greet() {
   console.log("Hello, world");
}
```

Code blocks are useful for displaying code snippets in your Markdown document. You can specify the appropriate language for syntax highlighting depending on the programming language you are using.
