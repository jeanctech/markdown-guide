# Online Dating in Markdown

In Markdown, you can quote inline text or highlight specific portions of your content using single or double quotes. Here's how to do it:

1. **Single quotes (`'`) or double quotes (`"`)**: You can surround the text you want to quote inline with single or double quotes to give it an inline quote format. This is useful for highlighting a word or phrase within a paragraph.

    Example with single quotes:

    ``markdown
    This is an example of an inline citation with single quotes: 'Quoted text'.
    ``

    Example with double quotes:

    ``markdown
    This is an example of an inline citation with double quotes: "Quoted text."
    ``

    Both examples will look like this:

     ``markdown
     This is an example of an inline citation with single quotes: 'Quoted text'.
     This is an example of an inline citation with double quotes: "Quoted text."
     ``

Inline quoting is useful when you want to highlight a specific word or phrase within a paragraph without using a full citation block.
