# Citations in Markdown

In Markdown, you can create citations or cited blocks of text by using the greater than symbol (`>`) at the beginning of each line you want to cite. Here's how to do it:

``markdown
>This is a date.
> Can be useful for highlighting text or code.
``

The above code will render as:

>This is a date.
> Can be useful for highlighting text or code.

You can use citation blocks to highlight text, quotes, code snippets, or other important information in your Markdown document. Citation blocks typically appear in a different visual format in most Markdown editors and platforms, making them easier to identify.
