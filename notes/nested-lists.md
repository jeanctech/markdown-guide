# Nested Lists in Markdown

You can create nested lists in Markdown to organize and structure information hierarchically. To do this, simply add spaces before the character that starts the list (either a hyphen, asterisk, or plus sign) to indicate nesting. Here's an example of how to create nested lists:

```markdown
- Element 1
- Element 2
   - Subelement 1
   - Subelement 2
- Element 3
```

The above code will render as:

```markdown
- Element 1
- Element 2
   - Subelement 1
   - Subelement 2
- Element 3
```

You can nest ordered lists in the same way. Here is an example:

```markdown
1. First element
2. Second element
    1. Sub-item 1
    2. Sub-item 2
3. Third element
```

This will look like this:

```markdown
1. First element
2. Second element
    1. Sub-item 1
    2. Sub-item 2
3. Third element
```

Note that the number of spaces you use for nesting is flexible, but it is recommended to maintain consistency in the number of spaces to make the document more readable.
