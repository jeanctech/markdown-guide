# Italics in Markdown

To apply italic formatting in Markdown, you can use a single asterisk (`*`) or a single underscore (`_`) around the text you want to highlight in italics. Here are examples of how to do it:

``markdown
*This text will be in italics*
_This text will also be in italics_
``

When using this syntax, text surrounded by an asterisk or underscore will appear in italics when the document is rendered. For example:

``markdown
*This text will be in italics*
``

Markdown is widely supported, so this syntax should work on most platforms and editors that support Markdown.
