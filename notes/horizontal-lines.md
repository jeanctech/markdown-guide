# Horizontal Lines in Markdown

To create horizontal lines in Markdown, you can use three or more special characters on a separate line. Characters typically used are hyphens (`-`), asterisks (`*`), or underscores (`_`). Here are examples:

```markdown
---
```

```markdown
***
```

```markdown
___
```

Either of these options will generate a horizontal line in your Markdown document. You can use these horizontal lines to separate sections or elements in your document and improve readability.

For example:

---

This is an example of a Markdown document with a horizontal line.
