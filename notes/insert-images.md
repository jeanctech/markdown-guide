# Insert Images in Markdown

To insert images into Markdown, use the following syntax:

```markdown
![Alt text](Image url)
```

Here's how you can do it:

- **Alt Text**: You must provide descriptive alt text for the image. This is important for accessibility and will be displayed if the image does not load. You must enclose the alt text in square brackets `[ ]`.

- **Image URL**: You must provide the URL or web address of the image you want to display. You must enclose the URL in parentheses `( )`.

Here is an example of how to insert an image in Markdown:

```markdown
![Example alternative text](https://www.example.com/imagen.jpg)
```

In this example, "Example alt text" is the text that will describe the image, and "https://www.example.com/image.jpg" is the Url of the image that will be displayed in the document.

Markdown will automatically render this syntax as an image in the final document. Readers will see the image and if they hover over it, they will be able to see the alt text as a tooltip.

Make sure you provide valid URLs for the images and that the images are available online for readers to view.
