# Markdown Inline Code

In Markdown, you can format text as code inline by using backticks (`\``) around the text you want to display as code. Whenever you surround text with grave accents, the text appears in a monospace font or inline code formatting. Here is an example:

``markdown
This is an example of `inline code`.
``

The result will look like this:

``markdown
This is an example of `inline code`.
``

This is a useful way to highlight code or commands within a paragraph of normal text.
