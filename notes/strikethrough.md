# Strikethrough in Markdown

To apply strikethrough text formatting in Markdown, use two tildes (`~~`) around the text you want to strikethrough. Here is an example of how to do it:

```markdown
~~This text will be crossed out~~
```

When using this syntax, the text surrounded by the two tildes will appear crossed out when the document is rendered. For example:

```markdown
~~This text will be crossed out~~
```

Markdown is widely supported, so this syntax should work on most platforms and editors that support Markdown.
