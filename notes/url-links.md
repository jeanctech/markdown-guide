# Url Links in Markdown

To create Url links in Markdown, you can use the following syntax:

```markdown
[Link text](Url)
```

Where:

- "Link text" is the text you want to display as the link.
- "Url" is the web address you want the link to point to.

Here is an example of how to create a URL link in Markdown:

```markdown
[Visit the example website](https://www.example.com)
```

In this example, "Visit the example website" is the link text that will be displayed in the document, and "https://www.example.com" is the web address to which the link will take readers when click on it.

Markdown will automatically render this code as a hyperlink in the final document. Readers will be able to click the link text to access the specified Url.
