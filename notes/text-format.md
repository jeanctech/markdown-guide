# Makdown Text Format

In Markdown, you can format text using a variety of elements. Below are the most common text formats:

1. **Bold:** To make the text appear bold, you can use two asterisks `**` or two underscores `__` around the text.

   Example:
   `markdown
**Bold text**
__Bold text__
`

2. **Italics:** To italicize text, use a single asterisk `*` or a single underscore `_` around the text.

   Example:
   `markdown
*Text in italics*
_Text in italics_
`

3. **Strikethrough text:** If you want the text to appear strikethrough, you can use two `~~` tildes around the text.

   Example:
   `markdown
~~Striked out text~~
`

4. **Text in code:** To format the text as code, use the backtick (\`) around the text.

   Example:
   `` markdown
`Online code`
 ``

5. **Subscript and superscript:** You can use the underscore `_` to create subscript text and the caret `^` to create superscript text.

   Example:
   `markdown
H~2~O (water)
X^2^ (X squared)
`

6. **Long Quotes or Code Blocks:** If you want to display a block of text as a long quote or code block, place a greater sign `>` at the beginning of each line.

   Example:
   ``markdown

   > This is a long quote.
   > Can be useful for highlighting text or code.
   > ``

7. **Horizontal line:** To insert a horizontal line, you can use three dashes `-`, three asterisks `*`, or three underscores `_` on a separate line.

   Example:
   ``markdown

   ***

   ``

8. **Links and references:** To create links, use square brackets `[]` for the link text and parentheses `()` for the link URL. You can also use reference tags for longer links.

   Example:
   ``markdown
   [Link text](https://www.example.com)
   [Link with reference][1]

   [1]: https://www.otroexample.com

   ``

These are some of the most common text formats in Markdown. You can combine them to format your documents effectively and readably.
